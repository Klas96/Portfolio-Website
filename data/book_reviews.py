    'title': 'CURENTLY READING: 12 Rules for Life',
    'year': 2000,
    'review': """
              In this book 12 ruels are presented as an antidote to chaos. My expectation when reading this book was a set off strict ruels to follow on faith. However I find that the auter describes the ruels quiet lenient. The book also gives a basis for the ruels by ilustarating with senarios or providening examples from biology or drawing interpretations from the bilbe; wich pertson regards as a meta-truth, a manifestation of the highest transcendent pattern.

filosofer = {
    'title': '20 filosofer',
    'year': 2024,
    'review': """
              The book covers 20 famous philosophers in the westen tradition throughout time. Starting with Plato and ending with Heidegger. The philosophers are presented in chronological order with some attention given to their personal lives and some given to what they contributed in form of thought.
              \n
              Personally I found the book interesting to read and it gave a look on the evolution of philosophy as well as how different philosophers' ideas have contributed.
